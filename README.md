# Virtual Reality Hands
I make some VR hands <br />
Based on the following paper <br />
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38.6690&rep=rep1&type=pdf <br/>

Todo list:

1. Grabbing works but not well, add smoothness to it
2. Should move along an vector when touchpad up is held down and then immediatly stop or with a little bit of drag
3. Should recall back immediatly or accelerated throwback on touchpad down
4. Better hand models than default

The landscape looks like this <br/>
Green majestic tree on top of a flat round hill. Player spawns under the tree with apples around it. A hatchet can be found lying at the base of the tree.
Surrounded by forest and a clear path to a small nearby village. Blue sky with clouds and the occasional wind effects.
Non player characters that are only there for show, no dismembering

Ideas, if I continue:
- A lightsaber imbued with the berculian effect
- Star wars force powers as alternative grabbing methods:

Three option types in the future:
- Remote controllable with linear/constant flying
- Remote controllable non linear, exponential increase in speed
- Player using force to extend and automatic retract (gum gum, boomerang style)


Project is sidelined for the moment, I will perhaps continue with this later. When/if I get a Virtual Reality Headset
Using Unity 2020 Version

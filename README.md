Todo list>

1. Grabbing works but not well, add smoothness to it
2. Using vector3 it should be possible to send out an arm. Regardless it should be experimented by making a boomerang or lightsaber
3. Should move along an vector when touchpad up is held down and then immediatly stop or with a little bit of drag
4. Should recall back immediatly or accelerated throwback on touchpad down

5. Distance grabbing should be possible.

6. Would still need some more material for the bachelor itself though

7. Actual hand models that isnt the grip models

PS. add comments to code, already forgot what some of it means

Extras> Green majestic tree on top of a flat round hill. Player spawns under the tree with apples around it. A hatchet can be found lying at the base of the tree.
Surrounded by forest and a clear path to a small nearby village. Blue sky with clouds and the occasional wind effects.
Non player characters that are only there for show, no dismembering
A lightsaber imbued with the berculian effect.
Star wars force powers as alternative grabbing methods:
Four types:
remote controllable with linear/constant flying
remote controllable non linear, exponential increase in speed
player using force to extend and automatic retract (gum gum, boomerang style)
fixed distance button press
Although it is possible, the reason we don't see it because it just adds to motion sickness

The report should be ...
